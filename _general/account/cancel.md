## How To Delete Your User Account

To completely cancel or delete your Codeship user account, just [get in touch with our helpdesk](https://helpdesk.codeship.com) and request your account to be deleted. That will completely remove access to the Codeship and remove your user and user data.

If you are interested in cancelling your subscription or deleting your organization account checkout the corresponding section on the [organization account article]({{ site.baseurl }}/general/account/organizations/) here:
