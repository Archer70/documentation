On Codeship, you are able to define **deployment pipelines**. A deployment pipeline is bound to a branch. Every time you push a new commit or tag to this branch, you trigger a build for it and the build will kick off your deployment pipeline.

<div class="info-block">
You can add **multiple deployments within one deployment pipeline**. This way you can, for example, deploy to a staging environment first and, if that succeeds, follow up with a deployment to the production environment. This process is fully automated on Codeship and in case of errors you will get notified immediately. It is *not possible to run multiple deployments in parallel*.
</div>

## Set up a deployment pipeline
Go to the ***Deployment*** page of your project settings to set up your deployment.

Add a branch that you would like to deploy and save it.
![Create Deployment Branch]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/create_branch.png)

Choose your hosting provider or deployment method.
![Choose Deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/choose_deployment.png)

Fill out the deployment configuration and click the green checkmark on the top right of your deployment to save it.
![Save Deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/save_deployment.png)

On the next push to this branch (in this case 'master') the deployment will be triggered under the condition that all setup and test commands pass successfully.
![Saved Deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/saved_deployment.png)

Now you can add additional deployments or configure another deployment pipeline.

## Add additional deployment methods

You can add multiple deployments to one deployment pipeline. They will run sequentially and can be ordered by dragging the deployment symbol.

## Deploy another branch
If you want to create a deployment pipeline for another branch, click on "Add a branch to deploy" and enter the branch name.
![Add additional Branch]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/continuous-deployment/add_additional_branch.png)

After saving the deployment pipeline you can add your deployment methods for that branch.

**Note:** you can also use a wildcard branch to setup one deployment pipeline to be used for similar branches, e.g. feature branches. See [Wildcard Deployments]({% link _basic/getting-started/wildcard-deployment-pipelines.md %}) for more details on using wildcard branches.

## Edit Branch Settings
By clicking on "Edit Branch Settings" you can change the branch name or delete that branch.

## Use Script Deployment for custom deployments / commands

You can use the [Script Deployment]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _basic/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-custom-scripts.md %}) to run your custom deployment commands or to execute other tasks right after or before a deployment.
